1. In a large bowl place rice, flour and yeast. 2. Start adding eggs and water. Mix well, cover the bowl and let it rise for 45 minutes.
2. After the mixture has risen add coconut milk, sugar and salt. Mix well until the mixture becomes a thick batter.
3. Heat the hopper pan and when hot pour 80ml of batter and swirl quickly to coat the sides of the pan. When the crust forms on a hopper its ready to be eaten.
